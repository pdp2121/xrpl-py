The mpt-crypto library is a cryptographic toolkit specifically designed to enable confidential Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) transactions on the XRP Ledger. It details the implementation of core cryptographic primitives, including ElGamal encryption for confidential amounts, Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs for equality and correct encryption, and Bulletproofs for efficient range proofs, all leveraging the libsecp256k1 framework. The library provides the foundational cryptographic operations necessary for managing private balances and ensuring the integrity of confidential ledger state transitions.
